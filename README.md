## Translation Notes

(In January 2019 we are finalizing a new process for translations. Until it is complete, please coordinate all translations with shawn@w3.org Thanks.)

**Check if the [player is available in your translated language](https://github.com/ableplayer/ableplayer/blob/master/README.md#user-content-supported-languages).**

* If the _**is**_ available in the translated language, the player will automatically switch to the language (once we have it implemented). Therefore, you should translate the words from the video player interface. Please also:
   * Make a new image to replace https://www.w3.org/WAI/content-images/wai-video-standards-and-benefits/show-language.png
   * Name it show-language-[language code].png for example: _**show-language-fr.png**_
   * Upload it to the [content-images folder](https://github.com/w3c/wai-video-standards-and-benefits/tree/master/content-images/wai-video-standards-and-benefits)
      * Select "Upload files"
      * Drag or choose the file
      * Select "Commit changes"
   * In your translation, add the language code to the image address.
* If the player is **not** available in the translated language, under the "Translations" heading:
   * Do not translate the following words from the video player interface; leave them in English:
     * "Captions"
     * "Show transcript"
     * "Language" _in this sentence: Use the Language drop-down to select subtitles._
   * Mark up the English words with the language attribute: "`<span lang="en">Captions</span>`".
