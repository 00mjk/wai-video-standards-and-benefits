## Translation Notes

This resource is ready for translation.

* If the [player is available in the translated language](https://github.com/ableplayer/ableplayer/blob/master/README.md#user-content-supported-languages), then translate the words from the video player interface. The player will automatically switch to the language once we have it implemented.
* If the [player is **not** available in the translated language](https://github.com/ableplayer/ableplayer/blob/master/README.md#user-content-supported-languages), under the "Translations" heading:
   * Do not translate the following words from the video player interface; leave them in English:
     * "Captions"
     * "Show transcript"
     * "Language" _in this sentence: Use the Language drop-down to select subtitles._
   * Mark up the English words with the language attribute: "`<span lang="en">Captions</span>`".
