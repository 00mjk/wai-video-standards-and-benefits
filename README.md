## Translation Notes

**_(In January 2019 we are finalizing a new process for translations. Until it is complete, please coordinate all translations with shawn@w3.org Thanks.)_**

* If the [player is available in the translated language](https://github.com/ableplayer/ableplayer/blob/master/README.md#user-content-supported-languages), the player will automatically switch to the language (once we have it implemented). Therefore, you should translate the words from the video player interface. Please also:
   * Make a new image to replace https://www.w3.org/WAI/content-images/wai-video-standards-and-benefits/show-language.png
   * Name it show-language-[language code].png for example: _**show-language-fr.png**_
   * Upload it to the [content-images folder](https://github.com/w3c/wai-video-standards-and-benefits/tree/master/content-images/wai-video-standards-and-benefits)
      * Select "Upload files"
      * Drag or choose the file
      * Select "Commit changes"
   * In your translation, add the language code to the image address.
* If the [player is **not** available in the translated language](https://github.com/ableplayer/ableplayer/blob/master/README.md#user-content-supported-languages), under the "Translations" heading:
   * Do not translate the following words from the video player interface; leave them in English:
     * "Captions"
     * "Show transcript"
     * "Language" _in this sentence: Use the Language drop-down to select subtitles._
   * Mark up the English words with the language attribute: "`<span lang="en">Captions</span>`".
